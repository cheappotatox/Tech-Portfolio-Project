                <div class="portfolio-body">While making my design, I took into consideration of the mass, surface & fluid friction, and aerodynamics.</div>
                <div class="portfolio-body"><strong>Mass:</strong></div>
                <div class="portfolio-body">One of the primary considerations was the mass of the dragster. Understanding the relationship between mass and acceleration, I aimed to strike a balance between having enough mass for stability and traction while minimizing excess weight that could impede speed. Utilizing lightweight materials strategically positioned in the design allowed for an optimal mass distribution, ensuring that my dragster would have the necessary heft for stability without compromising its overall speed potential.</div>
                <div class="portfolio-body"><strong>Surface Friction + Fluid Friction:</strong></div>
                <div class="portfolio-body">Surface and fluid friction were additional critical elements influencing my design decisions. Acknowledging that friction acts as a formidable opposing force, I carefully considered the dragster's contact points with the track. The shape and smoothness of the wheels, in particular, were integral to minimizing surface friction, allowing the dragster to glide more efficiently along the track. Reducing surface friction not only maximizes speed but also enhances the dragster's ability to maintain momentum, a key factor in drag racing.</div>
                <div class="portfolio-body"><strong>Aerodynamics:</strong></div>
                <div class="portfolio-body">Aerodynamics emerged as a pivotal aspect in shaping my dragster's design. The streamlined form of the dragster plays a crucial role in reducing air resistance, a force that can significantly impede speed. Employing principles of aerodynamics, I sculpted the body of my dragster to minimize drag, ensuring that it would cut through the air with minimal resistance. This streamlined design not only enhances the dragster's acceleration but also contributes to its overall stability during the race.</div>
                <div class="portfolio-body">Furthermore, I considered the dimensions and contours of the dragster's body to optimize its aerodynamic efficiency. Smoothing out rough edges and minimizing any protruding features helped create a sleek, aerodynamically sound profile. By carefully crafting the external shape, I aimed to ensure that my dragster would harness the power of Boyle's Law and the expelled CO2 gas to achieve maximum forward thrust with minimal air resistance.</div>
