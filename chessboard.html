                Welcome to my chessboard (arimaa) project. This project will be about making a chessboard with arimaa pieces. I am collabing with Sullivan Tan to make this project. This website will include the cut-off list (list that has all the dimensions of our components), my sketchup design (on the pieces) and the process of making my pieces.

            <div class="portfolio-body">
                What really inspired Sullivan and I to do this project is our passion on chess, but we realized that it is way too challenging to make chess pieces. At the same time, we want to make something that we can interact with well, which is a board game. My friend Sullivan also wanted to make our project multi-purpose. Therefore, we decided to choose our the project "arimaa." Our idea is to make a checkers-like piece with words on top, describing each of the pieces, and flip it around in order to play checkers.
