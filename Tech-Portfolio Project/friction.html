                Friction can significantly impact the speed of a CO2 Dragster in a race. Friction is the force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact. In the context of a CO2 Dragster, friction primarily affects the Dragster's speed in two main ways:
                <div>
                    <p><strong>1)</strong> Rolling friction with track</p>
                    <p><strong>2)</strong> Air Resistance / aerodynamic friction (We will discuss about this in the air resistance and aerodynamics section)</p>

                        The first scenario where the wheels of our Dragster make contact with the ground to create friction, will be the primary scenario we will be discussing in this section. There are two types of friction, static friction and kinetic friction:

                            <div class="portfolio-text15">Static friction is like a helpful friend that keeps things from sliding when you're trying to keep them still (Friction that counters inertia).

This type of friction occurs when two surfaces are touching each other but not moving relative to each other yet. Static friction acts in the opposite direction of the force you apply, preventing the object from budging (e.g if your force is denoted as F<div class="small-text">A</div>, force F<div class="small-text">f</div>/static friction will prevent the object from remaining in motion).</div>
                            <div class="portfolio-text17">In simpler terms, static friction is the 'stickiness' between two surfaces that stops them from sliding against each other when they're at rest.

                            <div class="portfolio-text20">The higher the coefficient of static friction between two materials, the more force is required to initiate movement. For example, if the coefficient of static friction between rubber and the floor is high, it'll be hard to slide a rubber mat across the floor.

                            In the static friction formula, N represents the normal force. The normal force is the force exerted perpendicular (at a right angle) to the surface of contact between two objects. It's the force that the surface applies to support the weight of an object resting on it. Here is a clearer representation of variable N:

                                    When an object is resting on a surface (e.g., a table or the ground), the force of gravity is acting downwards, which is the weight of the object (mg, where m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity). -> (See diagram above).

                                    The surface, in response, exerts an equal and opposite force in the upward direction, which is the normal force (N).

                                    The normal force is <strong>always</strong> perpendicular to the surface the object is resting on. If the object is on a flat surface, the normal force is directed straight upwards (opposite to the gravitational force).

                                    In the static friction formula (F<div class="small-text">static</div>≤μ<div class="small-text">s</div>N), N is used to calculate the maximum static friction (F<div class="small-text">static</div>) that can occur between two surfaces.
                                    <div class="portfolio-text30">The maximum static friction (F<div class="small-text">static</div>) is directly proportional to the normal force (N) exerted on the object by the surface. In other words, depending on that force N (the force acting perpendicular to the surface), the static friction or also known as "stickiness" of the two surfaces (object and the table let's say) will change in a constant way (direct variation). Therefore, to reduce static friction (the "stickiness" of the two surfaces), we must reduce the force N.</div>

                                    So, in simple terms, N in the static friction formula is the 'push-back' force provided by the surface to keep the object in place, and the static friction is limited to a maximum value (μ<div class="small-text">s</div>N) that depends on this normal force.
