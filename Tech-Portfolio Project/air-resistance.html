                First of all, we will talk about the general rule of air resistance. Whenever a place has an atmosphere, there is air resistance. Why? It's because air resistance is caused by the collision of a solid object with the air molecules in the atmosphere. Without an atmosphere, there wouldn't be gas molecules, leading to no air resistance, but primarily death. 
                <div class="portfolio-text3">
                    But why exactly is air resistance a key factor? Take a look at the following picture below:

                    <div>
                        <i class="description-text">How different shapes affect air resistance (drag)</i>
                    </div>
                    <div class="portfolio-text4">
                        From the picture above, we can see different possible vehicle shapes and how much air resistance they resist. Here, there is something different about all these. Notice how the shapes with a high drag have greater frontal surface area than the one's that have lower drag? That is because when the air molecules meet a certain point, they separate from each other. It is known that the less dramatic the separation (size of the separation) is, the more drag is reduced.

                    <div class="portfolio-text5">
                        In addition, we can see a large area of turbulent flow in front of each of the objects (indicated by swirls). The reason turbulent flow creates a greater friction drag is because it covers more surface area. In order to reduce drag, we must make sure that the turbulent flow should not interact with a very big surface area. In the image above, because there is not a very large frontal surface area, there is not a lot of surface area for the turbulent flow to interact with, thus creating less friction drag.
