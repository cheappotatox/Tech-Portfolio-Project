                Reflection:
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">
                This page will be about a throughout reflection on what went well in the dragster race, what I learned and what could have been improved.
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-body"><strong>What went well:</strong></div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">
                Here is a video of the dragster race:
                <video class="video" width="640" height="360" controls>
                    <source src="Images/dragster.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">
                It may not seem clear, but the time was 1.589 seconds (thought I was getting like 10.1s, 1.589s for 20m is faster than any human wearing any legal clothing – For context: Tyson Gay covered 20m in 1.6s with an illegal tailwind of 4.1m/s in his 9.68s 100m, Usain Bolt covered 20m in 1.61s with a legal tailwind of 0.9m/s in his 9.58s 100m in the Berlin Championship finals, and also 1.61s with a legal tailwind of 1.5m/s in his 9.63s 100m in the London Olympic games final, all were wearing top physique clothing). This is equivalent to: 
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">
                20m / 1.589s = 12.5865 m/s, or 45.31 km/h
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">
                One thing I would like to share is that I learned a lot about mechanical engineering and had lot’s of fun. For example, I learned how to operate various machines, and applied principles of design, physics, and engineering.
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">
                I also familiarized myself with a bunch of machines and sketching softwares (Sketchup). Familiarity with diverse machines and sketching software is crucial in design and engineering. Tools like Computer-Aided Design (CAD) streamline the design process, enabling efficient creation and precise virtual prototyping. Proficiency in these tools enhances communication, collaboration, and adaptability, ensuring adherence to industry standards and facilitating the seamless integration of design with manufacturing processes for overall project success.
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">While making this website with various markup languages, I gained a little more experience with working with development environments, and discovered new softwares like "Adobe Dreamweaver" that helps me work more smarter while editing my website.</div>
            <div class="portfolio-body"><strong>What could be improved:</strong></div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">During the race, I realized I could have trimed off a lot of weight. I could have made it much thinner like the winner’s of the competition. I could have also reduced the housing around the CO2 Dragster hole. I could have made it a little more aerodynamic. Many people realized that air could get trapped under the CO2 Dragster hole component. This is why I got close to last in the finals.</div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">During the race I added too much WD-40. I noticed that it will reduce the friction coefficient of my axles to the housing around it, but I added too much (well I spilled too much) and it became really uncontrollable. It is like adding water into your rubix cube in order to make it rotate faster, it’s hard to put such a rotation at a halt.</div>
