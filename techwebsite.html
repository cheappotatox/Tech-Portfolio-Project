            <div class="portfolio-body">
                Welcome to my CO2 Dragster project. This project will be about making a CO2 Dragster car. The goal of this project is to design the fastest possible CO2 Dragster car. This project will include all the safety measures of each machine, a 3D sketchup of the car, the steps of designing the car, some research and general foundation on physics ideas such as the boyle law, friction, mass and aerodynamics, and will include my "Skilled-trade Slideshow".

                The goal of the CO2 dragster project is to provide students with a hands-on, practical experience in applying principles of design, physics, and engineering. Students typically design and build small dragster cars from materials like balsa wood, incorporating a CO2 cartridge as a propulsion system. The project serves as an educational tool to teach students about aerodynamics, weight distribution, friction, and precision in craftsmanship. The final race of the CO2 dragsters, often held in a competitive setting, allows students to see the real-world application of their design and engineering skills as they test the performance of their dragsters in a controlled environment. Overall, the project aims to foster creativity, problem-solving, and practical understanding of scientific and engineering concepts in a fun and engaging manner.
