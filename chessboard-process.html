            <div class="portfolio-body"><strong>1. Wood Selection</strong></div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">
                There are two types of wood we need for our chessboard. We need a wood for the lighter-colored squares, and one for the darker-colored squares. The two woods we chose for our chessboard are maple wood (lighter) and rosewood (darker). Since we need an 8x8 chessboard, we need 4 maple wood and 4 rosewood, each needed to be in a (16in)(2in) dimension. But since we are not guaranteed to perfectly align them together in the gluing section, we must make the dimensions of our wood a little longer, as we would need to sand the extra parts off after gluing them together. The dimensions that we cut out was (17in)(2in), but we may have needed (19in)(2in), as we barely had our 16in in length after sanding everything.

            <div class="portfolio-body">
                We first aligned the maple wood and rosewood into a pattern. Afterwards, we glued them together. It looked like this (left):

            <div class="portfolio-body">
                After sanding out the extra parts with the table saw, we used the mitre saw to cut the pieces out like the picture above on the right. In order to glue it, we simply grabbed the cut out pieces and flipped them to the other side so that when glued, no adjacent squares of the same color are touching. Again, we used the table saw to sand out the extra parts. The inside of our chessboard is now complete.

            <div class="portfolio-body"><strong>3. Making the outside</strong></div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">
                We want a (19in)(19in) border for our chessboard. This border is divided into 4 congruent isoceles trapezoids, with bases of length 16in and 19in, and slant lengths of √4.5in. We used the mitre saw to cut (19.5in)(2in). Our idea is to first test out the dimensions, then slowly make it a little smaller. It is always a good idea to start big, and work your way to your desired results. There would be a pair of 135° and a pair of 45°. In order to cut the 45° angle, we will rotate the mitre saw at a 45° degree angle and make a cut. Afterwards, we glued the 4 congruent isoceles trapezoids around our chessboard. To increase precision, we decided to glue two pieces that are adjacent to each other first.

            <div class="portfolio-body"><strong>4. Sanding off the glue</strong></div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">We are aware that sandpaper will take too much time. Instead, we used a sanding machine that rotates at a very rapid pace. Under the sanding machine is a 80 grit sandpaper. We use this sanding machine to sand off the glue. This is what a sanding machine looks like:
            <img class="sanding-machine" src="https://img.fruugo.com/product/3/22/803564223_max.jpg">
            <div class="portfolio-body">
                We do this to both sides.
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-body"><strong>5. Filling in the cracks</strong></div>
            <div class="portfolio-body">After sanding the chessboard, there are bits of miniscule wood chips that the sanding machine collects. We use those bits of miniscule wood chips to fill in any cracks we had in our chessboard. We mixed the miniscule wood chips with glue and applied them to the cracks of our chessboard. We were very careful in this process, making sure that we did not miss a crack. After a while, we used the machine again to sand off the glue on our chessboard. Our chessboard is now complete. Next, we will be working on our arimaa pieces. These pieces are checker-shaped pieces with words on top. This is something that is not too intricate nor simple at the same time.</div>
